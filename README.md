Toolkit for playing around with quantum mechanics.

## General

This project is loosely based on work done for the edX course The Quantum World (CHEM160x).

The library provides classes and functions for building simple quantum systems and drawing various plots based on them.  Complex-valued wavefunctions can be created from sets of eigenstates and then plotted over space or momentum axes.  Wavefunctions can be sampled at given times to produce trajectories which can then be used for further plotting or animation.
